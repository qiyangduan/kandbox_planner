# Structure of src folder

## backend
The structure under this folder is a typical django project, with exception of kandbox_planner. kandbox_planner is the backend algorithm part.

## frontend
This part is not useful in current project. It was because I borrowed docker-compose structure from project  [cookiecutter-django-vue](https://github.com/vchaptsev/cookiecutter-django-vue)
